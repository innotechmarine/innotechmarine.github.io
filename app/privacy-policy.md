# Accutroll Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: June 30, 2025**

By using the Accutroll app (the "App"), you agree to this Privacy Policy. Accutroll is an Android and iOS app developed by [Innotech Marine](https://innotechmarine.co/) to connect, discover, configure, and manage Accutroll IoT-enabled throttle controllers for sportfishing.

## Collection of Information

The Accutroll app collects minimal information necessary for its functionality:
- **Network Information**: Wi-Fi network details (SSID and PSK) are cached locally on your device to facilitate connection and discovery of Accutroll throttle controllers.
- **Local Storage Settings**: Browser-specific settings, such as enabling or disabling advanced configuration options, are stored locally to enhance your user experience.

We do not collect personal information (e.g., name, email, or location), device identifiers (e.g., IP address, device ID), or usage data (e.g., analytics or telemetry).

## How We Use Your Information

The information collected is used solely to:
- Enable the App to connect to and configure Accutroll throttle controllers.
- Retain user preferences (e.g., advanced settings) for a seamless experience.

## Email Communications

If you contact us via email for support or feedback, we will retain your email and email address for quality assurance purposes. These will be used only to respond to your inquiries or suggestions and will not be used for marketing purposes.

## Disclosure of Information

We do not share any information collected by the App with third parties. The App does not use third-party integrations, analytics, or advertising services. We will only disclose information if expressly authorized by you or as required by law.

## Data Storage and Security

All information (network details and local storage settings) is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to external servers or the cloud. We rely on your device’s standard security measures to protect this data. Data is retained until you delete the App or clear its cache.

## Your Choices

You may delete the App’s cache or storage through your device’s settings. Note that deleting this data will remove network information and settings required for the App to function, and you may need to reconfigure your Accutroll devices.

## Cookies and Tracking Technologies

The App does not use cookies, web beacons, or similar tracking technologies. Local storage is used only for browser-specific settings, as described above.

## Children’s Privacy

The Accutroll app is intended for users aged 16 and older. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 16. If we learn that data from a user under 16 has been collected, we will take steps to delete it.

## International Users

The App is designed for users in the United States and Canada. If you use the App from another region, you are responsible for compliance with local laws.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will notify you of material changes via an in-app notice or by posting the updated policy at [https://docs.accutroll.com/app/privacy-policy.html](https://docs.accutroll.com/app/privacy-policy.html). Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
